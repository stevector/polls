## Customize dependencies
dependencies:
  pre:
#    - npm install coffeescript # install from a different package manager

  override:
 #   - bundle install: # note ':' here
 #      timeout: 180 # fail if command has no output for 3 minutes
        # IMPORTANT NOTE: ^^ the timeout modifier above must be
        # double indented (four spaces) from the previous line
  
  # we automatically cache and restore many dependencies between
  # builds. If you need to, you can add custom paths to cache:
  cache_directories:
#    - "custom_1"   # relative to the build directory
#    - "~/custom_2" # relative to the user's home directory

## Customize test commands
test:
  override:
    - Rscript runmodel.R
